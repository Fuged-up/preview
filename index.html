                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p class="mb-5 text-start indent">Betty and Sun Studio is a small music production company located in Milwaukee, WI. We use industry standard tools to bring either our clients or your clients’ ideas to full potential. From start to finish, we will always be there with our clients to insure that we deliver high quality products that meet their needs.<br></p>

                    <p class="mb-5 mt2 text-start indent">Our core goal and mission is to help and improve the arts community and entertainment industry.</p>

                <h4 class="ah">Betty</h4>
                <h6 class="ah2"><strong>Engineer/Producer</strong></h6>
                <p class="text-start indent">Betty grew up in a non-musical family, but that did not stop him from pursuing his passion in music and audio technology. As not just a sound engineer but also a musician, Betty integrates both of his passions together in order to recreate what he hears into what he shares with others. His core belief in the knowing and understanding the why and how things work not only allows for him to be fluent in his craft, but also allows him to express his ideas with clients and invoke creativity with the projects that he is given.<br></p>
                <p class="text-start indent">Betty graduated from Minnesota State University Moorhead, where he enrolled in the Entertainment Industry Technologies Program with an emphasis on Audio Technology. He has taken courses in audio theory, sound for video, and has done studio projects ranging from podcasts to mixing entire songs. He also graduated from Saint Paul College with an Associate’s in Fine Arts – Music where he expanded his knowledge on music theory, composition, and live musical performances. Due to the blend of both worlds, Betty considers himself a musician first and applies this to his workflow, whether it is mixing vocals into a backing track or creating a new track for clients using his knowledge of theory and composition.<br></p>
                <p class="text-start mb-8 indent">Betty co-founded Betty &amp; Sun Studio, where he is currently working with artists to build a portfolio for when he graduates.<br></p>

                <h4 class="ah">Sun</h4>
                <h6 class="ah2"><strong>multimedia</strong>/marketing<br></h6>
                <p class="text-start">Growing up Sun always had a passion for the arts. So, this no surprise that during his upbringing, Sun began learning Graphical and Web Design alongside Music.</p>
                <p class="text-start">After High School, Sun attended Saint Paul College in the Multimedia Degree Program and expanded his knowledge on Multimedia. He is proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Adobe Products.</p>
                <p class="text-start">&nbsp;Sun is a hard worker and even during his studies, he found employment for local family owned businesses. There he held responsibilities pertaining to business such as record keeping and marketing.&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="text-start indent"></p>
                <p class="text-start">Although Sun has a multitude of business skills on hand, Sun is also reminded that at his core, he is a musician at heart. With this combination, he has teamed up with Betty to co-found Betty and Sun Studio, where he wishes to give art back to the community in the same way that it was given to him growing up.</p>
